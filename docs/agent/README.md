## AI Agent Context

When working with TMI authentication:

1. **Primary Flow**: TMI uses OAuth 2.0 Implicit Flow for web clients
2. **Test Provider**: Built-in test OAuth provider for development
3. **JWT Tokens**: Authentication uses JWT tokens with specific claim structure
4. **Multi-Provider**: Supports Google, GitHub, Microsoft OAuth providers

## Usage Notes

This documentation is optimized for AI comprehension with:

- Detailed visual diagrams
- Step-by-step process flows
- Complete technical specifications
- Context for system behavior understanding

The diagrams and flows here complement the implementation guides in the developer documentation, providing the visual and architectural context needed for AI-assisted development work.
