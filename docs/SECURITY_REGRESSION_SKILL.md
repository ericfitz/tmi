# SECURITY_REGRESSION_SKILL.md

> **Status:** draft. This document accumulates regression-prevention rules as we close threats from `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` and `docs/THREAT_MODEL_RESPONSE_PLAN.md`. It will eventually be transformed into a Claude Code skill that runs against any change touching security-sensitive code paths.

## Purpose

When TMI fixes a security threat, the *fix* is one PR but the *regression risk* is forever — a future refactor, a new caller, or a copy-paste of an old pattern can re-open the hole. This skill is the durable memory of every closed threat. For each closed threat, it records:

1. **What the threat was** — the underlying class of bug, in plain language.
2. **The dangerous pattern** — the code shape that creates it.
3. **The required pattern** — the single sanctioned way to do the safe thing.
4. **Detection signals** — `rg` patterns, file globs, AST shapes that the reviewer agent can search for.
5. **Tests that pin the fix** — names of tests that exist specifically to break if the regression returns.

## How to use this skill (reviewer agent)

When invoked against a diff or branch, do the following:

1. For every section below, run the **Detection signals** queries against the changed files. If a signal fires, surface it with the section title as the issue label.
2. For every section, verify the **Tests that pin the fix** are still present and pass. A deleted or skipped pinning test is a regression even if no other code changed.
3. Output a report grouped by section, marking each as `OK`, `REVIEW` (signal fired but might be intentional), or `BLOCK` (signal fired in a way that matches the dangerous pattern verbatim).

## How to extend this skill

When closing a new security issue, append a new section using the template at the bottom of this document. Keep sections focused on **one threat class** — if a single issue closes multiple threats, write one section per threat.

## Closed threats (regression rules)

### T3 — Server-side request forgery via user-supplied URLs (#345)

**Threat class:** SSRF / DNS rebinding
**Closed by:** #345
**Threat-model reference:** `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` §4 T3 (also partial T26)

#### What was wrong

Outbound HTTP from TMI handlers (Timmy HTTP fetch, Timmy PDF fetch, webhook delivery, webhook challenge, Timmy HTTP source) called `client.Do(req)` after a hostname-based SSRF check. The validator resolved the hostname, walked the IPs through a blocklist (private/loopback/link-local/`169.254.169.254`), and approved the URL — but the actual `client.Do(req)` then re-resolved the hostname at dial time. An attacker DNS server with TTL=0 could return a public IP at validation time and a private IP a moment later, walking the request to AWS/GCP metadata, RFC1918 networks, or Redis on localhost.

Each caller also instantiated its own `http.Client`, so there was no single egress point at which to add IP-pinning, response-header timeouts, or response body caps.

#### Dangerous pattern (do NOT reintroduce)

```go
// BROKEN: validator resolves once, but client.Do re-resolves at dial time.
import (
	"net/http"
	"time"
)

type Provider struct {
	ssrfValidator *URIValidator
	client        *http.Client
}

func New(v *URIValidator) *Provider {
	return &Provider{
		ssrfValidator: v,
		client:        &http.Client{Timeout: 30 * time.Second}, // <-- not pinned
	}
}

func (p *Provider) Fetch(ctx context.Context, rawURL string) error {
	if err := p.ssrfValidator.Validate(rawURL); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	req, _ := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, "GET", rawURL, nil)
	resp, err := p.client.Do(req) // <-- DNS rebinding window
	...
}
```

Any new file that builds its own `*http.Client` and routes outbound TMI traffic through it reintroduces this bug.

#### Required pattern (use THIS instead)

All server-originated outbound HTTP MUST flow through `api.SafeHTTPClient` (`api/safe_http_client.go`). The helper resolves once via a configurable `HostResolver`, walks every IP through `URIValidator.checkIP`, and pins the dialed IP via a custom `Transport.DialContext` that ignores the address argument:

```go
import "time"

type Provider struct {
	client *SafeHTTPClient
}

func New(v *URIValidator) *Provider {
	return &Provider{
		client: NewSafeHTTPClient(
			v,
			WithUserAgent("TMI-...."),
			WithDefaultTimeouts(30*time.Second, 5*time.Second, 10*1024*1024),
		),
	}
}

func (p *Provider) Fetch(ctx context.Context, rawURL string) error {
	res, err := p.client.Fetch(ctx, rawURL, SafeFetchOptions{
		MaxBodyBytes: 10 * 1024 * 1024,
	})
	...
}
```

For streaming downloads (e.g. PDF that goes to a temp file) use `FetchStreaming`, which returns an `*http.Response` whose body is wrapped in `LimitReader` bound by `MaxBodyBytes`.

#### Detection signals

- **rg pattern (block):** `rg -nP '\bhttp\.Client\s*\{' --type go -- api/ auth/` — fires when any non-helper file constructs an `http.Client`. Generated code (`api/api.go`) and the helper itself (`api/safe_http_client.go`) are the only legitimate hits.
- **rg pattern (block):** `rg -nP 'http\.NewRequestWithContext\(.*,\s*(http\.MethodGet|"GET"|"POST"|http\.MethodPost)' --type go -- api/ | rg -v 'safe_http_client'` — fires when a handler builds a request directly. Acceptable if the request is then handed to a SafeHTTPClient (rare); otherwise this is the bug.
- **rg pattern (review):** `rg -n 'net\.LookupHost|net\.DefaultResolver' --type go -- api/ auth/` — fires when code does its own DNS lookup. Should only appear inside `safe_http_client.go` and `ssrf_validator.go`.
- **Files of interest:** `api/timmy_content_provider_*.go`, `api/webhook_*_worker.go`, `api/content_source_http.go`, `api/safe_http_client.go`. Any new file that fits the pattern "fetch user-supplied URL" must be reviewed.
- **Manual check:** confirm `webhookHTTPClient(...)` from `api/webhook_base_worker.go` is not used by new code paths — it is a legacy shape and should be removed once unused.

#### Tests that pin the fix

- `api/safe_http_client_test.go::TestSafeHTTPClient_PinsResolvedIP` — confirms exactly one DNS resolution per Fetch.
- `api/safe_http_client_test.go::TestSafeHTTPClient_BlocksRebindToPrivateIP` — confirms ALL resolved IPs are checked, not just the first.
- `api/safe_http_client_test.go::TestSafeHTTPClient_BlocksLiteralPrivateIP` — confirms RFC1918, loopback, link-local, and cloud-metadata are blocked.
- `api/safe_http_client_test.go::TestSafeHTTPClient_BlocksLocalhostHostname` — confirms symbolic local hostnames are blocked.
- `api/safe_http_client_test.go::TestSafeHTTPClient_RedirectNotFollowed` — confirms redirects are not auto-followed (defense for redirect-to-private-IP).
- `api/safe_http_client_test.go::TestSafeHTTPClient_BodyCapTruncates` — confirms body cap.
- `api/safe_http_client_test.go::TestSafeHTTPClient_ResponseHeaderTimeout` — confirms slow-loris-on-headers defense (T26).
- `api/safe_http_client_test.go::TestSafeHTTPClient_DialAddressIgnored` — confirms the dial uses the pinned IP, not the URL host.

#### Notes

- A future `make check-no-direct-http-client` lint rule should grep for `http.Client{` in `api/` and fail the build for non-allowlisted files. Until that lint exists, the rg patterns above are the tripwire.
- The `URIValidator.Validate` method remains for *reference* URI validation (e.g. `issue_uri` stored on a threat model) where no fetch happens. Reuse there is fine; what we forbid is `Validate(...) → custom http.Client.Do(...)`.

### T16 — Open redirect / OAuth phishing (#343)

**Threat class:** open redirect / OAuth phishing
**Closed by:** #343
**Threat-model reference:** `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` §4 T16

#### What was wrong

`/oauth2/authorize` accepted an arbitrary `client_callback` query parameter, stored it in Redis under the OAuth state, and at callback time issued `c.Redirect(http.StatusFound, redirectURL)` to that exact URL. Any attacker could send a victim a link containing `client_callback=https://evil.com/grab`, and after the victim authenticated TMI would redirect them — with the authorization code or session token attached — to the attacker.

The content-OAuth flow (`/me/content_oauth/...`) already used `api.ClientCallbackAllowList`. The main `/oauth2/authorize` flow had no equivalent.

#### Dangerous pattern (do NOT reintroduce)

```go
// BROKEN: client_callback flows from query → state → redirect with no allowlist.
clientCallback := c.Query("client_callback")
// ... store in Redis, eventually:
c.Redirect(http.StatusFound, clientCallback+"?code="+authCode+"&state="+state)
```

Any new auth handler that accepts a redirect target from the request and uses it without an exact-match (or wildcard-suffix) allowlist re-opens this hole.

#### Required pattern (use THIS instead)

`/oauth2/authorize` validates `client_callback` against `auth.ClientCallbackAllowList` (`auth/client_callback_allowlist.go`) before storing or redirecting. The allowlist is configured via `auth.oauth.client_callback_allowlist` in YAML or the comma-separated `TMI_OAUTH_CLIENT_CALLBACK_ALLOWLIST` env var. **An empty allowlist rejects every client_callback (fail-closed)** — the startup logs a warning so operators know they need to populate it.

```go
clientCallback := c.Query("client_callback")
if clientCallback != "" {
	allow := NewClientCallbackAllowList(h.config.OAuth.ClientCallbackAllowList)
	if !allow.Allowed(clientCallback) {
		c.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, gin.H{
			"error":             "invalid_request",
			"error_description": "client_callback is not in the allowlist",
		})
		return
	}
}
```

The same allowlist concept exists in the api package (`api.ClientCallbackAllowList`) for the content-OAuth flow. They are intentionally duplicated rather than shared — `auth` cannot import `api` without a cycle. Keep behavior in sync if either changes.

#### Detection signals

- **rg pattern (block):** `rg -nP 'c\.Redirect\([^,]+,\s*c\.Query\(' --type go -- auth/ api/` — fires when a redirect target comes directly from a query parameter without an intervening allowlist call.
- **rg pattern (block):** `rg -nP 'c\.Redirect\([^)]+(clientCallback|client_callback|callbackURL)' --type go -- auth/ api/ | rg -v 'allow\.Allowed|CallbackAllow'` — fires when the redirect goes to a callback variable but no `Allowed(...)` check is on the same path.
- **rg pattern (review):** `rg -n 'client_callback' --type go -- auth/ api/` — every match should be near an allowlist call or a `_test.go` file.
- **Files of interest:** `auth/handlers_oauth.go`, `auth/client_callback_allowlist.go`, `api/content_oauth_handlers.go`, `api/content_oauth_callbacks.go`.

#### Tests that pin the fix

- `auth/client_callback_allowlist_test.go::TestClientCallbackAllowList_EmptyRejectsEverything` — fail-closed default.
- `auth/client_callback_allowlist_test.go::TestClientCallbackAllowList_RejectsAttackerVariants` — host-suffix smuggling, scheme mismatch, protocol-relative.
- `auth/handlers_oauth_client_callback_test.go::TestAuthorize_RejectsClientCallbackOutsideAllowlist` — end-to-end allowlist enforcement on `/oauth2/authorize`.
- `auth/handlers_oauth_client_callback_test.go::TestAuthorize_EmptyAllowlistRejectsAnyCallback` — pins fail-closed behavior for unconfigured operators.
- `auth/handlers_oauth_client_callback_test.go::TestAuthorize_AllowedClientCallbackPassesAllowlist` — pins that legitimate callbacks survive.

#### Notes

- Operators MUST configure `auth.oauth.client_callback_allowlist` in production. A startup warning is logged when the list is empty; the warning should escalate to an error in a future hardening pass once tooling guarantees no operator forgets.
- Wildcard patterns (`*` suffix only) are intentional: prefix-matching captures variable-path callbacks like `http://localhost:8079/cb?run=...` while preventing host smuggling because the prefix includes the full host.
- Dev / test config files (`config-development*.yml`, `config-test*.yml`) ship with the OAuth callback stub URL pre-populated. Do not strip those entries; new dev onramp depends on them.

### T25 — Information disclosure via verbose error responses (#359)

**Threat class:** information disclosure / Zero-500 policy
**Closed by:** #359
**Threat-model reference:** `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` §4 T25, `CLAUDE.md` Zero 500-Error Policy

#### What was wrong

CATS fuzzing surfaced 8× HTTP 500 on `PATCH /admin/surveys/{survey_id}` from the ExamplesFields fuzzer. The handler manually classified store errors: "duplicate constraint" became 409, **everything else became 500**. Constraint violations (NOT NULL, varchar-length, CHECK) — exactly the class of error a fuzzer or a confused client triggers — were therefore reported as server errors, leaking internal context and violating the Zero-500 policy.

The same pattern (`logger.Error → http.StatusInternalServerError`) exists in many handlers. This regression rule applies to all of them.

#### Dangerous pattern (do NOT reintroduce)

```go
// BROKEN: every store error that isn't a duplicate gets a 500.
if err := GlobalSurveyStore.Update(ctx, &patched); err != nil {
	if isDuplicateConstraintError(err) {
		c.JSON(http.StatusConflict, ...)
		return
	}
	logger.Error("Failed to update survey: %v", err)
	c.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, ...) // <-- catches ErrConstraint, ErrForeignKey, ...
	return
}
```

Equally dangerous: handler bypasses the validator and lets the database emit the error message. The DB error string can leak schema names, column names, or trigger details.

#### Required pattern (use THIS instead)

1. **Classify store errors via `StoreErrorToRequestError`** (`api/request_utils.go`). It maps `dberrors.ErrNotFound → 404`, `ErrDuplicate → 409`, `ErrConstraint → 400`, `ErrForeignKey → 400`, `ErrTransient → 500`, default → 500.
2. **Validate at the handler boundary** before the store call so column-length, not-null, and enum constraints surface as `400 invalid_input` with a descriptive message — not as a database error.

```go
if err := validatePatchedSurvey(&patched); err != nil {
	HandleRequestError(c, err)
	return
}
if err := GlobalSurveyStore.Update(ctx, &patched); err != nil {
	if isDuplicateConstraintError(err) { /* 409 */ }
	HandleRequestError(c, StoreErrorToRequestError(err, "Survey not found", "Failed to update survey"))
	return
}
```

For a new resource handler: mirror the gorm tags from `api/models/*.go` (`type:varchar(N)`, `not null`, etc.) into a boundary validator. The validator is a defensive duplication of the DB schema; that duplication is intentional.

#### Detection signals

- **rg pattern (block):** `rg -nP 'http\.StatusInternalServerError.*ErrorDescription' --type go -- api/ | rg -v 'StoreErrorToRequestError|ServerError\('` — fires when a 500 is hand-rolled in a handler. Each hit should either route through `StoreErrorToRequestError` or use a `RequestError`-builder helper.
- **rg pattern (block):** `rg -nP 'logger\.Error\([^)]+\)\s*$\s*c\.JSON\(http\.StatusInternalServerError' -U --type go -- api/` — fires for the "log + return 500" anti-pattern.
- **rg pattern (review):** `rg -n 'isDuplicateConstraintError' --type go -- api/` — every hit should be paired with a `StoreErrorToRequestError` call on the non-duplicate branch.
- **Files of interest:** `api/survey_handlers.go`, `api/threat_model_handlers.go`, `api/threat_sub_resource_handlers.go`, plus any new resource handler.

#### Tests that pin the fix

- `api/survey_handlers_patch_500_test.go::TestPatchAdminSurvey_NoServerErrorOnConstraintViolation` — pins that `dberrors.ErrConstraint` becomes 400, not 500.
- `api/survey_handlers_patch_500_test.go::TestPatchAdminSurvey_RejectsOversizeName` — pins the boundary validator catches over-length values.
- `api/survey_handlers_patch_500_test.go::TestPatchAdminSurvey_RejectsEmptyName` — pins the not-null validator.
- `api/survey_handlers_patch_500_test.go::TestPatchAdminSurvey_RejectsInvalidStatus` — pins the enum validator.
- `api/survey_handlers_patch_500_test.go::TestPatchAdminSurvey_NotFoundReturns404` — pins typed not-found classification.
- CATS regression: `make cats-fuzz` followed by `make analyze-cats-results` — should report **zero 500s** on `/admin/surveys/{survey_id}`. Re-add to the post-merge gate after #359.

#### Notes

- This rule applies to ALL admin handlers — the survey one was the canary because a CATS fuzzer happened to pick it. Future hardening sweeps should grep handlers in `api/` for the dangerous pattern and migrate them to `StoreErrorToRequestError`.
- A boundary validator should NEVER call out to the database (no FK lookups). Its job is to enforce the same invariants the DB schema enforces, fast and locally.
- The Zero-500 policy in `CLAUDE.md` is the durable rule. This regression entry is the operational shape of that rule for store-backed handlers.

### T23 — Sensitive-data leak via observability (#349)

**Threat class:** sensitive-data leak / info disclosure
**Closed by:** #349
**Threat-model reference:** `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` §4 T23

#### What was wrong

`RedactSensitiveInfo` was applied to slogging output (request_logger, websocket_logger) but **not** to OTLP span attributes before export. Existing instrumentation set high-signal attributes like `threat_model.id` and `stream_type`, but any future call to `span.SetAttributes(attribute.String("authorization", req.Header.Get("Authorization")))` — easy to write by accident — would leak directly to the OTLP collector with no safety net.

The exposure depends on the operator's collector configuration; in a misconfigured stack it can reach Grafana / Jaeger / Prometheus dashboards that may not be locked down.

#### Dangerous pattern (do NOT reintroduce)

```go
// BROKEN: raw header / token / cookie value goes into a span attribute.
span.SetAttributes(attribute.String("authorization", c.GetHeader("Authorization")))
span.SetAttributes(attribute.String("client_callback", c.Query("client_callback")))
span.SetAttributes(attribute.String("session_cookie", c.Cookie("session")))
```

The above is dangerous, BUT — and this is the key point — even *correct* code that sets a benign-looking attribute key with a sensitive value can slip past review. The defense is to make the OTLP egress path itself redact, so that any future code change is implicitly safe.

#### Required pattern (use THIS instead)

OTel Setup wraps the span exporter with `internal/otel.RedactingSpanExporter` BEFORE installing the `WithBatcher`. Attribute keys matching the sensitive catalog (`authorization`, `bearer`, `cookie`, `password`, `secret`, `client_secret`, `client_callback`, `id_token`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `api_key`, `x-auth-token`, `jwt`, `token` — case-insensitive substring match) have their values replaced with `<redacted>` before reaching the OTLP collector.

```go
traceExporter, err = otlptracegrpc.New(ctx)
// ... fallback handling ...
traceExporter = NewRedactingSpanExporter(traceExporter) // <-- mandatory
tp := sdktrace.NewTracerProvider(sdktrace.WithBatcher(traceExporter), ...)
```

The redaction is implemented by wrapping each `sdktrace.ReadOnlySpan` in a thin `redactedReadOnlySpan` that overrides `Attributes()`. ReadOnlySpan's `private()` method makes the interface unimplementable from outside the SDK, but Go's structural embedding allows us to override individual methods while delegating the rest. Do NOT replace this approach with attribute-mutation in `OnEnd` — `OnEnd` receives a read-only span and there is no path from there to the export pipeline.

#### Detection signals

- **rg pattern (block):** `rg -nP 'NewTracerProvider\(' --type go -- internal/ cmd/` — every match should be near a `NewRedactingSpanExporter` call. If the wrap is removed or bypassed for a new tracer provider, the redaction is lost.
- **rg pattern (review):** `rg -n 'sdktrace\.With(Batcher|Syncer)\(' --type go -- internal/ cmd/ | rg -v 'Redacting'` — fires when an exporter is installed without going through the redactor. Test code (e.g. `tracetest.NewInMemoryExporter` directly) is acceptable; production paths are not.
- **rg pattern (review):** `rg -nP 'span\.SetAttributes\(.*(authorization|cookie|token|secret|password|client_callback)' --type go -- api/ auth/ internal/` — fires when sensitive data is being deliberately attached to a span. Even with the egress redactor, prefer NOT setting these in the first place.
- **Files of interest:** `internal/otel/otel.go`, `internal/otel/span_redaction_exporter.go`.

#### Tests that pin the fix

- `internal/otel/span_redaction_exporter_test.go::TestRedactingSpanExporter_RedactsSensitiveAttributes` — pins value-redaction across the full sensitive-key catalog.
- `internal/otel/span_redaction_exporter_test.go::TestRedactingSpanExporter_PreservesSpanIdentity` — pins that name/kind/trace-id are unchanged.
- `internal/otel/span_redaction_exporter_test.go::TestSensitiveAttributeKey_Catalog` — pins the catalog itself.

#### Notes

- The redactor is intentionally over-broad on the `token` substring: it catches `*_token`, `token_*`, and even keys like `tokenizer.version`. That is acceptable — span attributes are observability data, not load-bearing keys, and over-redaction is strictly safer than under-redaction.
- This fix does NOT address compose-stack auth on Grafana/Jaeger/Prometheus (the second half of #349). That is operational hardening tracked separately; the egress redactor is the cheap defense in depth that makes the compose surface less load-bearing.
- The §6 open question on OTLP redaction is closed by this fix.

### T15 — Brute-force of client_credentials / refresh tokens (#350)

**Threat class:** brute-force authentication / rate-limit bypass
**Closed by:** #350
**Threat-model reference:** `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md` §4 T15

#### What was wrong

The `/oauth2/token` endpoint had only a per-IP rate limiter. An attacker rotating IPs (botnet, residential proxies) could make unbounded `client_credentials` attempts against a single `client_id` without tripping the limiter. `bcrypt`-hashed secrets slow each guess but do not stop unbounded attempts.

The endpoint also did not surface 429 on repeated failures — every attempt returned 401, giving the attacker a clean signal to keep going.

#### Dangerous pattern (do NOT reintroduce)

```go
// BROKEN: no per-principal counter; bcrypt is the only brake.
case "client_credentials":
	tokenPair, err := h.service.HandleClientCredentialsGrant(ctx, req.ClientID, req.ClientSecret)
	if err != nil {
		if err.Error() == "invalid_client" {
			c.JSON(http.StatusUnauthorized, gin.H{"error": "invalid_client"})
			return
		}
		// ... no counter increment, no 429, no Retry-After
	}
```

Any new grant type that authenticates a principal (client_credentials, refresh_token, password — should we ever add it) must wire the same lockout, or attackers regain the brute-force window.

#### Required pattern (use THIS instead)

`auth.OAuthTokenLockout` (`auth/oauth_token_lockout.go`) is a Redis-backed counter keyed on `client:{client_id}`. The handler:

1. Calls `lockout.Check(ctx, "client:"+clientID)` BEFORE running bcrypt or any other auth work. If `Locked`, returns 429 with `Retry-After: <seconds>`.
2. On `invalid_client` failure, calls `lockout.RecordFailure(...)`. If the new count locks the client, returns 429 instead of 401 so the attacker observes the lockout.
3. On success, calls `lockout.Reset(...)` to clear the counter.

```go
ctx := c.Request.Context()
lockout := h.tokenLockout()
if d := lockout.Check(ctx, "client:"+req.ClientID); d.Locked {
	c.Header("Retry-After", strconv.Itoa(int(d.RetryAfter.Seconds())))
	c.JSON(http.StatusTooManyRequests, gin.H{"error": "too_many_requests", ...})
	return
}
tokenPair, err := h.service.HandleClientCredentialsGrant(ctx, req.ClientID, req.ClientSecret)
if err != nil && err.Error() == "invalid_client" {
	if d, _ := lockout.RecordFailure(ctx, "client:"+req.ClientID); d.Locked {
		c.Header("Retry-After", strconv.Itoa(int(d.RetryAfter.Seconds())))
		c.JSON(http.StatusTooManyRequests, ...)
		return
	}
	c.JSON(http.StatusUnauthorized, gin.H{"error": "invalid_client", ...})
	return
}
lockout.Reset(ctx, "client:"+req.ClientID)
```

Backoff schedule (don't change without a security review):
- 0–4 failures: no lock
- 5–9: Retry-After 1s
- 10–19: Retry-After 30s
- 20–49: Retry-After 5min
- 50+: Retry-After 1h (hard lock until the 1h Redis TTL expires)

#### Detection signals

- **rg pattern (block):** `rg -nP 'HandleClientCredentialsGrant\(' --type go -- auth/ api/ | rg -v '_test\.go|tokenLockout|lockout\.'` — fires when the grant is invoked without a surrounding lockout call.
- **rg pattern (block):** `rg -nP '"client_credentials"' --type go -- auth/handlers_token.go | rg -v 'tokenLockout|lockout\.'` — fires if the `client_credentials` switch arm loses its lockout wiring.
- **rg pattern (review):** `rg -n 'invalid_client' --type go -- auth/` — every match should be near a `RecordFailure` call.
- **Files of interest:** `auth/handlers_token.go` (`Token` handler `client_credentials` branch), `auth/oauth_token_lockout.go`, `auth/handlers.go` (`tokenLockout` accessor).

#### Tests that pin the fix

- `auth/oauth_token_lockout_test.go::TestOAuthTokenLockout_TierThresholds` — pins the backoff schedule.
- `auth/oauth_token_lockout_test.go::TestOAuthTokenLockout_AfterFiftyFailuresHardLock` — pins the AC: 50 failures → 1h Retry-After.
- `auth/oauth_token_lockout_test.go::TestOAuthTokenLockout_ResetClearsCounter` — pins the AC: success resets.
- `auth/oauth_token_lockout_test.go::TestOAuthTokenLockout_PerClientIsolation` — pins that the counter is per-client_id.
- `auth/handlers_token_lockout_test.go::TestToken_ClientCredentials_LockoutReturns429` — pins the end-to-end handler behavior: locked client gets 429 + numeric Retry-After.

#### Notes

- The lockout fails open when Redis is unavailable. A Redis outage should not lock out every legitimate client. The trade-off is acceptable because the per-IP limiter is still in place.
- `refresh_token` grants are not yet wired through the lockout. Refresh tokens are high-entropy and not realistically brute-forceable, so the priority is the `client_credentials` path. Add the same wiring if/when the threat model changes.
- The fail-open behavior is also why we audit-log every lockout decision (`Warn` level): an operator monitoring those logs is the second line of defense if Redis goes down.
