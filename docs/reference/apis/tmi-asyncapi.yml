  title: TMI WebSocket API
  version: '1.0.0'
  description: |
    AsyncAPI specification for the Collaborative Threat Modeling Interface (TMI) WebSocket messaging.
    This API enables real-time collaborative editing of threat model diagrams with role-based access control.

    ## Features
    - Real-time collaborative diagram editing
    - Role-based access control (reader/writer/owner permissions)
    - JWT token authentication
    - Session management with automatic cleanup
    - Diagram operation validation

    ## Connection Flow
    1. Authenticate with JWT token
    2. Validate access permissions for the diagram
    3. Join or create collaboration session
    4. Exchange real-time diagram operations
    5. Receive join/leave notifications from other participants

    description: |
      WebSocket endpoint for collaborative diagram editing. Each diagram has its own collaboration session.
      Users must have at least reader permissions on the parent threat model to connect.

      ## Session Management
      - Sessions are automatically created when first client connects
      - Sessions include automatic cleanup after 15 minutes of inactivity
      - Multiple clients can participate in the same session simultaneously
      - Each session tracks active participants and their join times

    StateCorrectionMessage:
      name: StateCorrectionMessage
      title: State Correction
      summary: Server sends state correction notification with update vector
      description: |
        Message sent by server to notify clients that diagram state has changed and they
        should resynchronize with the server. Used in two primary scenarios:

        ## REST API Updates
        When a diagram is updated via REST API (not through WebSocket), all connected
        WebSocket clients receive a state_correction message containing the new update_vector.
        This signals them to fetch the latest diagram state via REST API and compare
        update vectors to determine if they need to resync.

        ## Conflict Resolution
        When WebSocket operations result in conflicts or invalid state, affected clients
        receive a state_correction message with the current authoritative update_vector.
        Clients should compare this with their local state and resync if necessary.

        ## Client Handling
        Upon receiving a state_correction message, clients should:
        1. Compare the provided update_vector with their local diagram state
        2. If the server's update_vector is higher, fetch the latest diagram via REST API
        3. Update their local state and resume normal operations
      payload:
        $ref: '#/components/schemas/StateCorrectionPayload'
      examples:
        - name: RestApiUpdateNotification
          summary: Notification of REST API update with new update vector
          payload:
            message_type: state_correction
            update_vector: 15
        - name: ConflictResolution
          summary: Conflict resolution with current authoritative update vector
          payload:
            message_type: state_correction
            update_vector: 23

    DiagramStateSyncMessage:
      name: DiagramStateSyncMessage
      title: Initial Diagram State Synchronization
      summary: Server sends complete diagram state upon client connection
      description: |
        Message sent by server immediately after a client connects to a WebSocket
        collaboration session. This ensures the client has the current server state
        before sending any operations.

        ## Purpose
        Prevents "cell_already_exists" validation errors that occur when clients
        attempt to send operations based on stale REST API cached state. By receiving
        the current diagram state (including update_vector and all cells), clients can:
        1. Detect if their cached state is out of sync
        2. Compare update vectors to determine staleness
        3. Update their local state before sending operations

        ## When Sent
        - Immediately after client successfully joins WebSocket session
        - Sent before any other initial messages (current_presenter, participants_update)
        - Sent only to the newly connected client (not broadcasted)

        ## Client Handling
        Upon receiving a diagram_state_sync message, clients should:
        1. Compare the received update_vector with their local cached version
        2. If update_vector differs:
           - Option A: Use the received cells array to update local state
           - Option B: Fetch fresh diagram via REST API for complete synchronization
        3. Update local state before sending any diagram_operation messages
        4. If cells array is empty, the diagram has no cells yet (new diagram)

        ## Performance Considerations
        For diagrams with many cells (100+), the cells array may be large. Clients
        should handle this message asynchronously and may choose to fetch via REST API
        instead of processing the embedded cells array.

    OperationRejectedMessage:

      summary: Notification sent to operation originator when operation is rejected
      description: |
        Sent exclusively to the client that originated a diagram operation when
        the server rejects the operation due to validation failure, conflicts,
        or other reasons. This provides explicit feedback to the originating
        client that their operation was not applied or broadcast.

        **Key behaviors:**
        - Only sent to the originating client (never broadcast to others)
        - Includes the original operation_id for correlation
        - Provides structured reason codes for programmatic handling
        - May include the sequence number if one was assigned before rejection

        **Reason codes:**
        - `validation_failed`: Operation structure or data failed validation
        - `conflict_detected`: Operation conflicts with current diagram state
        - `no_state_change`: Operation would result in no actual state change (idempotent no-op)
        - `diagram_not_found`: Target diagram no longer exists
        - `permission_denied`: User lacks permission for this operation
        - `invalid_operation_type`: Operation type is not recognized
        - `empty_operation`: Operation contains no cell operations

            Current authoritative update vector for the diagram. Clients should

            If different, the client's cached state is stale and should be updated.

            Clients can use this to update their local state without an additional REST
            API call. For large diagrams (100+ cells), clients may choose to ignore
            this array and fetch via REST API instead for better performance.

      description: |
        JWT token authentication for WebSocket connections. Authentication is handled by 
        server-side middleware that validates JWT tokens provided as query parameters.

        ## Authentication Flow
        1. Client includes JWT token as query parameter: `?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1Q...`
        2. Server middleware validates token and extracts user claims
        3. Server verifies user has at least reader access to the threat model
        4. Server verifies the diagram exists within the specified threat model
        5. WebSocket connection is established if all validations pass

        ## Access Control
        - Users need minimum reader permissions on the parent threat model
        - Diagram must exist within the specified threat model
        - Token must contain valid user identification claims (sub, email)

        Example: ws://localhost:8080/threat_models/123/diagrams/456/ws?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1Q...
