# TMI Custom CodeQL Query Pack
# This pack extends the default Go security queries with TMI-specific models
#
# The slogging package sanitizes all log messages to prevent log injection (CWE-117).
# This pack teaches CodeQL that SanitizeLogMessage() is a sanitizer, preventing
# false positives when user input flows through the slogging logging methods.
