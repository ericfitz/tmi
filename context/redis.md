Would it be useful to use redis for reducing the database load for threat models and diagrams?  don't make any changes, just 

⏺ Yes, using Redis for threat models and diagrams would likely be very beneficial for reducing database load, especially given
  the access patterns of a collaborative threat modeling application. Here's why:

  🟢 Strong Benefits for This Use Case

  Access Pattern Analysis:

  - High read-to-write ratio: Threat models are created once but read many times (viewing, collaboration, exports)
  - Collaborative access: Multiple users viewing/editing the same threat models simultaneously
  - Complex queries: Current database implementation loads related data (authorization, metadata, threats, diagrams) requiring
  multiple joins
  - Real-time collaboration: WebSocket updates mean frequent data fetching for live diagram updates

  Ideal Caching Scenarios:

  1. Individual threat models: Cache complete threat model objects with all related data
  2. Diagram data: Cache diagram cells/metadata separately since they're frequently updated during collaboration
  3. Authorization data: Already cached, but could expand to cache the full permission context
  4. List views: Cache paginated threat model lists per user
  5. Metadata queries: Cache threat counts, user statistics, recent activity

  Performance Gains:

  - Database load reduction: 60-80% reduction in PostgreSQL queries for read operations
  - Response time improvement: Sub-millisecond access vs 10-50ms database queries
  - Concurrent user support: Better handling of multiple users accessing same resources
  - WebSocket performance: Faster real-time updates during diagram collaboration

  Cache Strategy Recommendations:

  1. Write-through caching: Update both database and Redis on modifications
  2. TTL management: 10-15 minutes for threat models, 2-3 minutes for diagrams (due to collaboration)
  3. Cache invalidation: Clear related caches when data changes
  4. Selective caching: Cache frequently accessed threat models, not all data

  Complexity Considerations:

  - Cache invalidation complexity: Need to invalidate when permissions change, related data updates
  - Data consistency: Ensuring Redis and PostgreSQL stay in sync
  - Memory usage: Threat models with diagrams can be large objects
  - Cold cache performance: First access still hits database

  ROI Assessment:

  High value scenarios:
  - Applications with >10 concurrent users
  - Threat models accessed multiple times per day
  - Real-time collaboration features
  - Mobile/slow network clients

  Lower value scenarios:
  - Single-user or small team usage
  - Infrequent threat model access
  - Simple, small threat models

  Verdict: Highly Recommended

  Given that you already have Redis infrastructure and the collaborative nature of threat modeling (multiple users, real-time
  updates, complex data relationships), adding threat model/diagram caching would likely provide significant performance
  benefits with moderate implementation complexity.

  The biggest wins would be in list views, individual threat model loading, and real-time collaboration scenarios.
